## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if http-server is installed)
   npx http-server
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

4. Login with the default password: `notes123`

### Changing the Password

To change the default password, edit the `PASSWORD_HASH` constant in `script.js`:

```javascript
const PASSWORD_HASH = 'your-new-password';
```

For better security, consider implementing a hash function, though note that client-side security has inherent limitations.

## Deployment to Netlify

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify UI

2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Deploy manually"

3. Drag and drop your project folder (or zip file)

4. Your site will be live at a unique Netlify URL (e.g., `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`)

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository

2. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com) and click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"

3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository

### Theme Toggle
Click the theme button (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è) in the header to switch between light and dark modes. Your preference is saved automatically.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage:
- **Notes**: Stored as JSON with metadata (id, title, content, category, timestamps, pinned, archived)
- **Authentication**: Session state stored locally
- **Theme**: User preference saved

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Data is stored per browser/device. To sync across devices:
1. Export your notes as JSON backup
2. Save the backup file to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
3. Import the backup on other devices (manually via localStorage or implement import feature)

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (v90+)
- Firefox (v88+)
- Safari (v14+)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Security Considerations

This is a **client-side only** application with the following security characteristics:

‚úÖ **Pros**:
- No server-side data storage or processing
- Data stays on your device
- No network requests after initial page load

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:
- Password is stored in plain text in the JavaScript file
- Anyone with access to the source code can see the password
- No encryption of localStorage data
- Suitable for personal use, not for sensitive/confidential information

For better security:
- Deploy to a private URL
- Use a strong, unique password
- Change the default password
- Consider implementing bcrypt or similar hashing (though it won't prevent client-side inspection)

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3a86ff; /* Change this to your preferred color */
    --primary-hover: #2c6ddf;
}
```

### Adding Features
The codebase is well-structured and easy to extend:
- `script.js`: All JavaScript functionality
- `styles.css`: All styling
- `index.html`: HTML structure

## File Structure

```
personal-notes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All styling and themes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # All JavaScript functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ netlify.toml        # Netlify configuration

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE             # License file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          # Git ignore file
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notes not saving
