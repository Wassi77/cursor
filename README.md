## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Copy the Firebase configuration template and add your project credentials:
   ```bash
   cp firebase-config.example.js firebase-config.js
   ```
   Update the new `firebase-config.js` with your Firebase settings. See [Firebase Setup](#firebase-setup) for step-by-step guidance.

3. (Optional) Update the access password in `firebase-config.js` by setting `window.firestoreAccessPassword` to your desired password.

4. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if http-server is installed)
   npx http-server
   ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

6. Login with your configured password (default: `notes123`)

### Firebase Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** To enable cloud synchronization, you must set up Firebase Firestore. Without it, the app will show an error.

Follow the detailed setup guide in **[FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

**Quick summary:**
1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database and Anonymous Authentication
3. Copy `firebase-config.example.js` to `firebase-config.js`
4. Add your Firebase credentials to `firebase-config.js`
5. (Optional) Set a custom password in the same file

### Changing the Password

To change the default password, edit `firebase-config.js`:

```javascript
window.firestoreAccessPassword = "your-secure-password";
```

**Note:** The password is checked on the frontend only. Anyone with access to the source code can see it, so don't use this for highly sensitive information.

### Theme Toggle
Click the theme button (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è) in the header to switch between light and dark modes. Your preference is saved automatically.

## Data Storage

Cloud synchronization is handled by **Firebase Firestore**:
- **Notes**: Stored in Firestore with metadata (id, title, content, category, tags, timestamps, pinned, archived)
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes propagate instantly across connected devices
- **Offline Caching**: Firestore caches data locally and syncs when back online

Local storage is still used for non-sensitive preferences:
- **Authentication Session**: Tracks whether you're logged in on this device
- **Theme Preference**: Stores your light/dark mode selection

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Ensure you have configured Firebase before using the app. Without it, notes cannot be saved.

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (v90+)
- Firefox (v88+)
- Safari (v14+)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Security Considerations

This application uses **Firebase Firestore** for cloud storage with the following security characteristics:

‚úÖ **Pros**:
- Data stored in secure Google Cloud infrastructure
- Transport encryption (HTTPS/TLS)
- Firebase Anonymous Authentication for backend access control
- Firestore Security Rules to control database access
- Offline persistence with secure local caching

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:
- Password is checked on the frontend only (anyone with source code access can see it)
- No encryption of data at rest beyond Firebase's default security
- All users sharing the same password access the same note collection
- Suitable for personal use, not for highly sensitive/confidential information

**For better security:**
- Use a strong, unique password in `firebase-config.js`
- Don't commit `firebase-config.js` to public repositories (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Deploy to a private URL if possible
- Regularly backup your notes using the Export feature
- Monitor Firebase Console for unauthorized access attempts

**Firebase Security:**
- Anonymous authentication ensures only authenticated users can access Firestore
- Security Rules prevent unauthorized access to the database
- Firebase audit logs available in the console
- Free tier has generous limits for personal use

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3a86ff; /* Change this to your preferred color */
    --primary-hover: #2c6ddf;
}
```

### Adding Features
The codebase is well-structured and easy to extend:
- `script.js`: All JavaScript functionality
- `styles.css`: All styling
- `index.html`: HTML structure

## File Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css                # All styling and themes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js                 # Application logic with Firestore integration

```

> **Note:** Create `firebase-config.js` (ignored by Git) with your Firebase credentials based on the provided example file.

## Troubleshooting

### "Firebase configuration not found" Error
- Ensure `firebase-config.js` exists in the project root
- Verify it's properly configured with your Firebase project credentials
- Check the browser console for specific error messages
- See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for setup instructions

### Notes not saving
- Check internet connection and sync status indicator
- Verify Firebase project is set up correctly
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure Firestore security rules are configured properly
- Verify you're not exceeding Firebase free tier limits

### Sync Status shows "Error" or "Offline"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase project credentials are correct
- Check Firebase Console for service status
- Review Firestore Security Rules
- Try logging out and back in

### Migration prompt not appearing
- The app only prompts if localStorage contains notes AND you haven't migrated yet
- Check if `localStorage.getItem('notes')` has data in browser console
- The prompt only shows once; if skipped, it won't show again

### Notes not syncing across devices
- Ensure you're using the same password on both devices
- Verify both devices have internet connectivity
- Check sync status indicator on both devices
- Wait a few seconds for real-time sync to propagate

### Password not working
- Verify you're using the correct password from `firebase-config.js`
- Default is `notes123` unless changed
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Theme not persisting
- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Try toggling the theme again

### Multiple tabs warning in console
- This is normal - Firestore offline persistence can only be enabled in one tab
- App will still work correctly in all tabs
- Real-time sync will work across all open tabs

### Firebase quota exceeded
- Check your Firebase Console Usage tab
- Free tier: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- Consider exporting notes and clearing old data
- Upgrade to Firebase Blaze plan if needed (pay-as-you-go)
